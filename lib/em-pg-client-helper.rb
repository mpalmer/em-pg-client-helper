	# Sequel-based SQL generation.
	#
	# While we could spend a lot of time writing code to generate various
	# kinds of SQL "by hand", it would be wasted effort, since the Sequel
	# database toolkit gives us a complete, and *extremely* powerful, SQL
	# generation system, which is already familiar to a great many
	# programmers (or, at least, many great programmers).
	#
	# Hence, rather than reinvent the wheel, we simply drop Sequel in.
	#
	# Anything you can do with an instance of `Sequel::Database` that
	# produces a single SQL query, you can almost certainly do with this
	# method.
	#
	# Usage is quite simple: calling this method will yield a pseudo-database
	# object to the block you pass.  You can then call whatever methods you
	# like against the database object, and when you're done and the block
	# you passed completes, we'll return the SQL that Sequel generated.
	#
	# @yield [sqldb] to allow you to call whatever Sequel methods you like to
	#   generate the desired SQL.
	#
	# @yieldparam [Sequel::Database] call whatever you like against this to
	#   cause Sequel to generate the result you want.
	#
	# @return [String] the generated SQL.
	#
	# @raise [PG::EM::Client::Helper::BadSequelError] if your calls against
	#   the yielded database object would result in no SQL being generated,
	#   or more than one SQL statement.
	#
	# @example A simple select
	#   sequel(db) do |sqldb|
	#     sqldb[:artists]
	#   end
	#   # => "SELECT * FROM artists"
	#
	# @example Delete some rows
	#   sequel(db) do |sqldb|
	#     sqldb[:foo].where { { col.sql_number % 3 => 0 } }.delete
	#   end.callback do |res|
	#     logger.info "Deleted #{res.cmd_tuples}"
	#   end
	#   # => "DELETE FROM foo WHERE col % 3 = 0"
	#
	# @example A very complicated select
	#   sequel do |sqldb|
	#     sqldb[:posts].select_all(:posts).
	#       select_append(
	#         Sequel.
